 --mixed
 --soft
 --hard

1) reset with --mixed mode
   it is the default mode
   to discard commits in the local repository and changes in staging area
   it will not touch woring directory

Example :- git reset <mode> <commit id>


   git reset --mixed acb9dec (mixed mode will delete files from staging and commit area but not touch working directory)


2) reset with --soft mode
   it is exactly same  as --mixed but changes are available in working directory as well as in stagin area
   it won't touch staging are and working directory
   it will only remove from local repository
   As changes already present in staging  area, just we have to use commit to revert back.

3) reset with --hard mode
   it will remove from all three area, working directory, staging area, local repository permanentely
